# Advent of Code 2020 Solutions

My set of solutions for [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021), written in Golang because I'm _lazy_.

## Running

My inputs from the challenges are all stored in the `inputs` directory, and at the time of writing these files are effectively hardcoded into the running.

To run a particular day (i.e. _dayone_, _daytwo_, ...)
```
go run main.go -challenge dayone
```

To run all days
```
go run main.go -all
```
